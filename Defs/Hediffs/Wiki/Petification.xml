        <description><![CDATA[Pawns can currently be turned into 4 possible Pets
        
        To turn a Pawn into a Pet, the Pawn needs to undergo training.
        This is done by forcing the Pawn to wear Pet-Apparel, eat Pet-Food or hit the Pawn with the designated training weapon.
        
        Note: Turning a pawn into a pet can be long process, so expect multiple ingame days depending on how much training equipment you use.
        Also, most Pawns will rebell against the training, so be prepared for low moods and mental breaks.]]></description>
